In this project I have created Spam Detector for emails using the spam or ham The machine learning model I have used here is a multi dimensional Naive bayes Model to classify between spam and ham emails.

The application asks the user to enter the email into the text box.The processing of the text is done in the backend and the result specifies wheter the email was a spam or a ham email.

app.py=>Is the main application file which contains the implementation of the multi dimensional Naive Bayes algorithm.

email.sqlite=> This file contains all the cleaned, preprocessed emails and arranged in the desired manner which can be used by the application.

If you want a detailed view of the cleaning and preprocessing of the email data, check out () this directory.
