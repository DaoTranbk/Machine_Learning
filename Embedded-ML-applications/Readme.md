In this project I have created Spam Detector for emails using the spam or ham
The machine learning model I have used here is a multi dimensional Naive bayes Model to classify between spam and ham emails.

The application asks for the user to enter the email into the text box.The processing of the text is done in the backend and the result specifies wheter the email was a spam or a ham email.
