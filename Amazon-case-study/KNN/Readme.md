KNN_on_reviews.ipynb=> 
Here I have applied KNN algorithm to only the reviews column by creating a 50 dimension w2v.

KNN_on_summary_and_reviews.ipynb=>
Here I have appled KNN algorithm on both the reviews as well as  the summary columns by creating a 100 dimension w2v(50 for summary, 50 for reviews)

Preprocessing_creating_avg_w2v.ipynb=>
In this file I have used google w2v which is 300 dimension w2v model trained by google,created my own avg w2v model and a TFIDF weighted w2v model.
