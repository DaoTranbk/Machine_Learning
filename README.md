# Machine-Learning
### This repository consists of different machine learning case studies that I have solved.

### * Amazon Case Study
Amazon Fine Food Reviews dataset (https://www.kaggle.com/snap/amazon-fine-food-reviews). It is a classification problem. Machine Learning models used: K-nearest neighbours(KNN) classifier and logistic regression. The problem statement is to predict whether the given review is a positive review or a negative review (ie. score 0 (negative) or (positive) 1). I have used Bag-of-Words(BOW),TFIDF and Word-to-Vector(W2V) NLP techniques. If you want to see how Bag-of-Words(BOW),TFIDF and Word-to-Vector(W2V) work check BOW-TFIDF-W2V-DUMMY.ipynb. EDA_Cleaning_Preprocessing.ipynb contains cleaning, text preprocessing, exploratory data analysis (EDA) in detail.
